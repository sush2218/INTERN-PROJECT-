# INTERN-PROJECT-

This project is about predicting gestures on infrared images. which can be further developed and use on real time RGB images and can be installed in electronic devices like TVs, Washing Machines.
Project is divided into many sub parts a) Image preprocessing 
                                       b) Implementing a Deep Learning Model 
                                       c) Training and Testing the model 
                                       d) Installing it into a android device.
           I dealt with the prepocessing part of the project where we should read the image and deal with the uneven intensities and disturbances. Used many techniches for thresholding like binary , otsu etc
      Used some techniches like connected points , max mean intensity connected points to determine the important part of interest .
      
      The next part is implementing a Deep Learning model with several neural layers and defining the functions in it .
      Training is done on a huge dataset and got a accuracy over 95% 
      Then testing is done on another dataset with good accuracy over 94% 
      and Finally this model is deployed into a android device and check for a predicted gesture for a givn infrared image.
